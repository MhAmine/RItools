These .Rd manual files are all created by `make document`. Do not edit them directly.

If you want to change documentation, please edit the corresponding .R files in
the R/ directly. You'll see that we use the roxygen system for documenting code
and automatically generating manual pages (and other important aspects of R
packages)
